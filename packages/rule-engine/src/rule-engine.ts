 * The RuleEngine applies a sequence of deployment rules to filter candidate
 * releases and selects the most appropriate release based on configured
 * criteria.
 *
 * The engine works by passing releases through each rule in sequence, where
 * each rule can filter out releases that don't meet specific criteria. After
 * all rules have been applied, a final selection strategy is used to choose the
 * best remaining release.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Import necessary rules
 * import { DeploymentDenyRule } from '@ctrlplane/rule-engine';
 *
 * // Create rules with appropriate options
 * const rules = [
 *   new DeploymentDenyRule({
 *     ...
 *   })
 * ];
 *
 * // Create the rule engine
 * const ruleEngine = new RuleEngine(rules);
 *
 * // Evaluate a deployment context
 * const result = await ruleEngine.evaluate({
 *   desiredReleaseId: 'release-123',
 *   deployment: { id: 'deploy-456', name: 'prod-api' },
 *   resource: { id: 'resource-789', name: 'api-service' },
 *   availableReleases: [
 *     // Array of available releases to choose from
 *   ]
 * });
 *
 * // Handle the result
 * if (result.allowed) {
 *   console.log(`Deployment allowed with release: ${result.chosenRelease.id}`);
 * } else {
 *   console.log(`Deployment denied: ${result.reason}`);
 * }

   * 3. If any rule disqualifies all candidates, evaluation stops with a denial

   * - Rules should return ALL valid candidate releases, not just one
   * - This ensures subsequent rules have a complete set of options to filter
   * - For example, if multiple sequential upgrades are required, all should be
