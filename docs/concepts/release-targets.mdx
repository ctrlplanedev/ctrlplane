# Release Targets

A **Release Target** is the combination of a Deployment, Environment, and Resource. It represents a specific place where a deployment version can be released.

## Understanding Release Targets

The core formula:

```
Deployment × Environment × Resource = Release Target
```

### Example

Given:
- **Deployment**: API Service
- **Environment**: Production (matches 2 resources)
  - Resource 1: prod-cluster-us-east
  - Resource 2: prod-cluster-us-west
  
**Release Targets Created**:
1. API Service → Production → prod-cluster-us-east
2. API Service → Production → prod-cluster-us-west

Each release target can independently receive deployment versions.

## How Release Targets are Created

Release targets are created automatically based on selectors:

### 1. Environment Selector Matches Resources

Environment defines a resource selector:
```json
{
  "name": "Production",
  "resourceSelector": {
    "type": "metadata",
    "operator": "equals",
    "key": "environment",
    "value": "production"
  }
}
```

This matches all resources with `metadata.environment = "production"`.

### 2. Deployment Selector Further Filters (Optional)

Deployment can have an additional resource selector:
```json
{
  "name": "API Service",
  "resourceSelector": {
    "type": "kind",
    "operator": "equals",
    "value": "kubernetes-cluster"
  }
}
```

This limits the deployment to only Kubernetes clusters.

### 3. Intersection Creates Release Targets

The final set of resources is the intersection of:
- Resources matched by environment selector
- Resources matched by deployment selector (if present)

**Example Calculation**:

```
Environment "Production" matches:
  - prod-k8s-cluster-1 (kind: kubernetes-cluster, env: production)
  - prod-k8s-cluster-2 (kind: kubernetes-cluster, env: production)
  - prod-vm-server-1 (kind: vm, env: production)

Deployment "API Service" selector (kind: kubernetes-cluster):
  - prod-k8s-cluster-1 ✓
  - prod-k8s-cluster-2 ✓
  - prod-vm-server-1 ✗ (not a kubernetes-cluster)

Release Targets Created:
  1. API Service → Production → prod-k8s-cluster-1
  2. API Service → Production → prod-k8s-cluster-2
```

## Release Target Properties

```json
{
  "id": "rt_abc123",
  "deploymentId": "dep_api",
  "environmentId": "env_prod",
  "resourceId": "res_cluster1",
  "key": "dep_api:env_prod:res_cluster1",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### key
Unique identifier combining deployment, environment, and resource IDs.

Format: `{deploymentId}:{environmentId}:{resourceId}`

This key is used to track which version is currently deployed to each target.

## Release Target Lifecycle

### Creation

Release targets are created when:
- A new deployment is created (targets created for all matching environments and resources)
- A new environment is created (targets created for all deployments and matching resources)
- A new resource is created that matches existing environment selectors (targets created for all deployments)

### Deletion

Release targets are deleted when:
- The deployment is deleted
- The environment is deleted
- The resource is deleted or no longer matches the selectors

### Dynamic Updates

As resources are added, updated, or removed:
- Resource metadata changes → Release targets re-evaluated
- Resource matches environment selector → New release targets created
- Resource stops matching → Release targets removed

## Viewing Release Targets

### Via Web UI

1. Navigate to your deployment
2. Click "Release Targets" tab
3. See all targets with current deployed versions

### Via API

```bash
# List release targets for a deployment
curl https://app.ctrlplane.dev/api/v1/deployments/{deploymentId}/release-targets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CTRLPLANE_API_KEY"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "releaseTargets": [
    {
      "id": "rt_abc123",
      "deployment": {
        "id": "dep_api",
        "name": "API Service"
      },
      "environment": {
        "id": "env_prod",
        "name": "Production"
      },
      "resource": {
        "id": "res_cluster1",
        "name": "Production US East Cluster",
        "identifier": "k8s-prod-use1"
      },
      "currentRelease": {
        "versionTag": "v1.2.3",
        "status": "completed"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Release Target Matrix

Think of release targets as a 3D matrix:

```
                    Resources
                 ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
                 │ R1  │ R2  │ R3  │
    ┌────────────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │ Dev        │ RT  │ RT  │ RT  │ Environments
    │ Staging    │ RT  │ RT  │ RT  │
    │ Production │ RT  │ RT  │ RT  │
    └────────────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
                    ↑
               Deployment
```

Each cell "RT" is a release target.

For multiple deployments, this becomes a 3D cube:

```
          Deployments (layers)
               ↓
        [API] [Frontend] [Worker]
         ↓       ↓          ↓
    Environment × Resource matrices
```

## Release Target States

While release targets don't have an explicit "status" field, their state is determined by their current release:

### No Release
Target exists but no version has been deployed yet.

### Active Release
A version is currently being deployed (job in progress).

### Completed Release
A version is successfully deployed (job completed).

### Failed Release
Latest deployment attempt failed.

### Pending Release
A release exists but is waiting for approval/policies.

## Deployment Targeting Strategies

### Strategy 1: Broad Matching

Environment matches many resources, deployment doesn't filter:

```yaml
# Environment
resourceSelector:
  type: metadata
  operator: equals
  key: environment
  value: production

# Deployment (no selector)
# → Deploys to ALL production resources
```

**Result**: Deployment goes to every production resource.

**Use Case**: Services that should run everywhere (monitoring agents, logging).

### Strategy 2: Deployment-Level Filtering

Deployment limits which resources it can target:

```yaml
# Environment
resourceSelector:
  type: metadata
  operator: equals
  key: environment
  value: production

# Deployment
resourceSelector:
  type: kind
  operator: equals
  value: kubernetes-cluster
```

**Result**: Deployment only goes to production Kubernetes clusters.

**Use Case**: Platform-specific deployments (containers vs. VMs).

### Strategy 3: Fine-Grained Environments

Create specific environments for precise targeting:

```yaml
# Environment: Production Kubernetes US East
resourceSelector:
  type: metadata
  operator: and
  conditions:
    - key: environment
      value: production
    - key: region
      value: us-east-1
    - key: kind
      value: kubernetes-cluster
```

**Result**: Very specific set of release targets.

**Use Case**: Region-specific deployments, gradual rollouts.

## Release Target Locking

Release targets can be locked to prevent new deployments:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.ctrlplane.dev/api/v1/release-targets/{releaseTargetId}/lock \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CTRLPLANE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locked": true,
    "reason": "Maintenance window"
  }'
```

**Use Cases**:
- Maintenance windows
- Incident response (freeze deployments)
- Testing/debugging (keep specific version)

Locked targets won't receive new deployments until unlocked.

## Querying Release Targets

### By Deployment

```bash
GET /api/v1/deployments/{deploymentId}/release-targets
```

Shows all targets for a specific deployment.

### By Environment

```bash
GET /api/v1/environments/{environmentId}/release-targets
```

Shows all targets in a specific environment.

### By Resource

```bash
GET /api/v1/resources/{resourceId}/release-targets
```

Shows all targets for a specific resource (all deployments).

### With Filters

```bash
POST /api/v1/release-targets/query
{
  "deploymentId": "dep_api",
  "environmentId": "env_prod",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## Release Target Count Estimates

Before creating a deployment, estimate how many release targets will be created:

```bash
POST /api/v1/deployments/estimate-targets
{
  "systemId": "sys_abc",
  "resourceSelector": {
    "type": "kind",
    "value": "kubernetes-cluster"
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "matchingResources": 1,
      "releaseTargets": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "matchingResources": 3,
      "releaseTargets": 3
    }
  ],
  "totalReleaseTargets": 4
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Environment-Per-Region

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: API Service

environments:
  - name: Production US East
    resourceSelector:
      operator: and
      conditions:
        - key: environment
          value: production
        - key: region
          value: us-east-1

  - name: Production US West
    resourceSelector:
      operator: and
      conditions:
        - key: environment
          value: production
        - key: region
          value: us-west-2
```

**Release Targets**: API Service gets separate targets per region.

**Benefit**: Independent regional deployments, gradual rollout by region.

### Pattern 2: Tiered Resources

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: Critical Service
    resourceSelector:
      type: metadata
      operator: equals
      key: tier
      value: critical

  - name: Standard Service
    resourceSelector:
      type: metadata
      operator: equals
      key: tier
      value: standard

environments:
  - name: Production
    resourceSelector:
      type: metadata
      operator: equals
      key: environment
      value: production
```

**Release Targets**: Services only deploy to appropriate tier resources.

**Benefit**: Resource isolation, cost optimization.

### Pattern 3: Canary Deployments

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: API Service

environments:
  - name: Production Canary
    resourceSelector:
      operator: and
      conditions:
        - key: environment
          value: production
        - key: canary
          value: "true"

  - name: Production Stable
    resourceSelector:
      operator: and
      conditions:
        - key: environment
          value: production
        - key: canary
          operator: not_equals
          value: "true"
```

**Release Targets**: Separate targets for canary vs. stable.

**Benefit**: Test new versions on canary before rolling out to stable.

## Best Practices

### Resource Metadata Design

Design resource metadata with targeting in mind:

```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "zone": "us-east-1a",
  "tier": "critical",
  "team": "platform",
  "canary": "false"
}
```

This allows flexible targeting across multiple dimensions.

### Selector Simplicity

**Prefer Simple Selectors**:
```json
{
  "type": "metadata",
  "operator": "equals",
  "key": "environment",
  "value": "production"
}
```

**Over Complex Ones**:
```json
{
  "type": "cel",
  "expression": "(metadata.environment == 'production' || metadata.environment == 'prod') && (metadata.tier != 'deprecated') && ..."
}
```

Complex selectors are harder to understand and maintain.

### Validate Target Count

Before deploying:
1. Check estimated release target count
2. Verify targets match expectations
3. Test in lower environment first

### Monitor Release Targets

- Track release target creation/deletion events
- Alert on unexpected target count changes
- Review targets when resources are added/updated

## Troubleshooting

### Too many release targets created
- Review environment resource selectors
- Check if deployment needs a resource selector to filter
- Verify resource metadata is correct

### Expected targets not created
- Check environment selector matches resources
- Verify deployment selector (if present) isn't too restrictive
- Ensure deployment and environment are in same system
- Check resources exist and aren't deleted

### Targets created for wrong resources
- Review selector logic (AND vs. OR)
- Check resource metadata matches expectations
- Test selectors with query API before applying

### Release target disappeared
- Check if resource was deleted
- Verify resource still matches environment selector
- Check if resource metadata changed

## Next Steps

- [Releases and Jobs](./releases-and-jobs.md) - How versions deploy to targets
