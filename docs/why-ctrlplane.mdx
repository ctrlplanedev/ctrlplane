## Sound Familiar?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What version is running in prod-eu-west-1?">
    **The pain**: You check Kubernetes, then AWS console, then your team's spreadsheet. 15 minutes later, you're still not 100% sure.

    **With Ctrlplane**: Single inventory showing every resource and its current version, updated in real-time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can someone approve this deploy?">
    **The pain**: Slack message sent. Thread dies. Deploy sits for hours. You ping again. Finally someone approves at 6pm.

    **With Ctrlplane**: Built-in approval workflows with notifications. Approvers see pending releases in one place.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Staging passed—now deploy to prod">
    **The pain**: Manual step someone forgets. Or worse, staging didn't actually pass but prod got deployed anyway.

    **With Ctrlplane**: Auto-promote to production only when staging verification succeeds. No manual intervention needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We added a new cluster">
    **The pain**: Update 6 config files, 3 CI pipelines, and remember to tell the team. Miss one and deploys fail silently.

    **With Ctrlplane**: New clusters auto-join environments via selectors. Tag it `env: production` and it starts receiving deployments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rollback NOW!">
    **The pain**: Scramble to find the right commands. Which version was stable? Did we roll back all regions? Did we miss one?

    **With Ctrlplane**: Automatic rollback when verification fails. One-click manual rollback when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deploy to 10 regions without breaking everything">
    **The pain**: Either deploy to all at once (risky) or manually babysit each region (slow and error-prone).

    **With Ctrlplane**: Gradual rollouts deploy one region at a time, verify health, then continue—automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Problems at Scale

When you have 5 services and 2 environments, everything is manageable. When you hit 20+ services across 4 environments and 8 clusters, you start feeling the pain:

| Challenge | What Teams Do Today | What Goes Wrong |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Environment promotion** | Manual deploy after checking staging | Someone forgets, or staging wasn't actually verified |
| **Deployment verification** | "It deployed successfully!" | Service is broken, but pipeline says green |
| **Infrastructure visibility** | Spreadsheets + multiple dashboards | Outdated info, no source of truth |
| **Adding new infrastructure** | Update configs everywhere | Miss something, deploys fail |
| **Multi-region deploys** | Sequential manual deploys or YOLO all-at-once | Too slow or too risky |
| **Rollbacks** | Ad-hoc scripts and hope | Inconsistent, slow, error-prone |

## How Ctrlplane Helps

Ctrlplane is the **orchestration layer** between your CI/CD pipelines and your infrastructure:

```
Your CI/CD    ──►    Ctrlplane    ──►    Your Infrastructure
 (builds)            (orchestrates)           (deploys)
```

### Two Core Systems

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deployment Orchestration" icon="rocket">
    Controls **when** and **where** releases happen:
    - Auto-promote after verification
    - Approval gates for production
    - Gradual rollouts across regions
    - Automatic rollback on failure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure Inventory" icon="server">
    Tracks **what exists** and **what's running**:
    - Real-time resource inventory
    - Dynamic environment membership
    - Version tracking across all targets
    - Works with K8s, AWS, GCP, custom
  </Card>

## What Ctrlplane Is NOT

Ctrlplane doesn't replace your existing tools—it coordinates them:

- **Not a CI system** — Your CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins) still builds code
- **Not a GitOps engine** — ArgoCD/Flux still syncs manifests to clusters
- **Not infrastructure provisioning** — Terraform still creates your resources

Ctrlplane decides _when_ deployments should happen, _where_ they should go, and _whether_ they passed verification.

## Quick Example

Here's what deployment orchestration looks like with Ctrlplane:

**1. CI builds and creates a version:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.ctrlplane.dev/deployments/$ID/versions" \
  -d '{"tag": "v1.2.3", "status": "ready"}'
```

**2. Ctrlplane automatically:**
- Calculates which release targets need this version
- Deploys to staging first (environment progression policy)
- Runs verification checks against Datadog metrics
- After staging passes, requests approval for production
- Once approved, gradually rolls out to production clusters
- Verifies each cluster before proceeding to the next
- Auto-rolls back if any verification fails

**3. You get:**
- Full visibility in one dashboard
- Consistent process every time
- Confidence that verification actually passed
