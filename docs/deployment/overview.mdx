Ctrlplane's deployment system orchestrates releases across environments with
configurable policies, verification, and approval workflows.

## What is Deployment Orchestration?

Deployment orchestration manages how releases flow through your environments —
from build to production — with:

- **Gradual rollouts** — Deploy to targets sequentially with verification
  between each
- **Policy-driven gates** — Approvals, verification, and dependencies
- **Environment promotion** — Automated staging → production progression
- **Rollback & recovery** — Automatic rollback on verification failure

    end

    subgraph Production["Production"]
        direction TB
        P0["Approval"] --> P1["Deploy"] --> P2["Verify"]
    end

## How It Works

### 1. CI Creates Versions

Your CI pipeline creates a version after successful builds:

```yaml
- name: Create Version
  env:
    CTRLPLANE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CTRLPLANE_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    ctrlc api upsert version \
      --workspace ${{ vars.CTRLPLANE_WORKSPACE }} \
      --deployment ${{ vars.CTRLPLANE_DEPLOYMENT_ID }} \
      --tag ${{ github.sha }} \
      --name "Build #${{ github.run_number }}" \
      --metadata git/commit=${{ github.sha }} \
      --metadata git/branch=${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### 2. Ctrlplane Creates Releases

For each release target (deployment × environment × resource), Ctrlplane:

1. Evaluates policies (approvals, gates, dependencies)
2. Creates a release with the new version
3. Dispatches a job to the job agent

### 3. Job Agents Execute

Job agents perform the actual deployment:

- **GitHub Actions** — Trigger workflows
- **ArgoCD** — Create/sync Applications
- **Terraform Cloud** — Create workspaces and runs

### 4. Verification Validates

After deployment, verification checks health:

```yaml
verification:
  metrics:
    - name: error-rate
      provider:
        type: datadog
        queries:
          errors: "sum:errors{service:api}.as_rate()"
      successCondition: result.queries.errors < 0.01
```

## Policies

Policies control how releases flow through environments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Approval" icon="check" href="../policies/approval">
    Require sign-off before deployment
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Environment Progression"
    icon="arrow-right"
    href="../policies/environment-progression"
  >
    Gate production on staging success
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Gradual Rollouts"
    icon="chart-line"
    href="../policies/gradual-rollouts"
  >
    Deploy to percentage of targets
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Verification"
    icon="shield"
    href="../policies/verification/overview"
  >
    Validate deployment health
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Job Agents

Execute deployments on your infrastructure:

  >
    Trigger workflow dispatch

  <Card title="ArgoCD" icon="rotate" href="../integrations/job-agents/argocd">
    GitOps deployments
  </Card>
  <Card

  >
    Infrastructure as code
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Benefits

| Benefit                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Consistent process** | Same workflow for all deployments     |
| **Policy enforcement** | Gates prevent unauthorized releases   |
| **Visibility**         | Track what's deployed where           |
| **Automatic rollback** | Failed verification triggers rollback |
