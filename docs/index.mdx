## What is Ctrlplane?

**Ctrlplane is the orchestration layer between your CI/CD pipelines and your
infrastructure.**

Your CI builds code. Your infrastructure runs it. Ctrlplane decides _when_
releases are ready, _where_ they should deploy, and _what gates_ they must
pass—handling environment promotion, verification, approvals, and rollbacks
automatically.

```
Your CI/CD    ──►    Ctrlplane    ──►    Your Infrastructure
 (builds)            (orchestrates)           (deploys)
```

## Two Core Systems

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deployment Orchestration" icon="rocket" href="./use-cases/environment-promotion">
    Control **when** and **where** releases happen:
    - Auto-promote after verification passes
    - Approval gates for production
    - Gradual rollouts across regions
    - Automatic rollback on failure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure Inventory" icon="server" href="./use-cases/infrastructure-inventory">
    Track **what exists** and **what's running**:
    - Real-time resource inventory
    - Dynamic environment membership
    - Version tracking across all targets
    - Works with K8s, AWS, GCP, custom
  </Card>

## Common Use Cases

| Scenario | What Ctrlplane Does |
|----------|---------------------|
| [Multi-region deployments](./use-cases/multi-region) | Deploy to 10 clusters sequentially with verification between each |
| [Environment promotion](./use-cases/environment-promotion) | Auto-promote staging → prod when verification passes |
| [Deployment verification](./use-cases/deployment-verification) | Check Datadog metrics before marking a deploy successful |
| [Infrastructure inventory](./use-cases/infrastructure-inventory) | Answer "what version is running where?" instantly |
| [Dynamic environments](./use-cases/dynamic-environments) | New clusters auto-join environments via selectors |

## Who Uses Ctrlplane?

| Team | Use Case |
| ---- | -------- |
| **Platform Engineering** | Building an IDP with deployment orchestration and infrastructure visibility |
| **DevOps / SRE** | Enforcing deployment policies and tracking what's running where |
| **Scaling Startups** | Moving from "we manually deploy" to automated, policy-driven releases |
| **Multi-region Teams** | Coordinating deployments across clusters/regions with a unified inventory |

## How It Fits Your Stack

Ctrlplane doesn't replace your CI or deployment tooling—it coordinates them:

| Layer | Tools | What They Do |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| **Build** | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins | Build artifacts, create versions in Ctrlplane |
| **Orchestrate** | **Ctrlplane** | Decide when/where to deploy, enforce policies |
| **Execute** | ArgoCD, K8s Jobs, GitHub Actions, Terraform | Perform the actual deployment |
| **Monitor** | Datadog, Prometheus | Provide metrics for verification |
