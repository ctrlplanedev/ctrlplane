## What is Ctrlplane?

Ctrlplane is an open-source **deployment orchestration platform** that helps you
manage multi-stage deployment pipelines across diverse infrastructure
environments. Whether you're deploying to Kubernetes clusters, cloud functions,
VMs, or custom infrastructure, Ctrlplane provides a unified control plane for
orchestrating your deployments.

Think of Ctrlplane as the orchestration layer that sits between your CI/CD
system and your deployment targets, managing the complexity of progressive
delivery, approval workflows, and environment promotion.

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform deployments** - Deploy to Kubernetes, cloud functions, VMs,
  or any custom infrastructure
- **Progressive delivery** - Canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and
  phased rollouts
- **Policy-driven workflows** - Define approval gates, environment progression
  rules, and gradual rollouts
- **CI/CD integration** - Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or any
  CI system via REST API
- **Flexible job agents** - Execute deployments using Kubernetes jobs, GitHub
  Actions workflows, ArgoCD, or custom agents
- **Resource targeting** - Use powerful selectors to dynamically target
  deployment destinations
- **Deployment tracing** - Full visibility into execution with detailed traces

## How Ctrlplane Works

At a high level, Ctrlplane orchestrates deployments through these steps:

```txt
1. Build Phase (Your CI)
   └─> CI builds artifact
   └─> CI creates deployment version in Ctrlplane

2. Planning Phase (Ctrlplane)
   └─> Evaluates policies (approvals, progression, etc.)
   └─> Determines which resources need the new version

3. Job Creation (Ctrlplane)
   └─> Creates release + job for each target
   └─> (Deployment × Environment × Resource)

4. Execution Phase (Job Agents)
   └─> Agents poll for work
   └─> Execute deployments
   └─> Report status back

5. Observability (Optional)
   └─> Traces capture detailed execution steps
```

## Comparison to Other Tools

## When to Use Ctrlplane

Ctrlplane is ideal when you need:

- **Multi-environment deployments** - Managing dev, staging, and production
  environments
- **Approval workflows** - Requiring manual gates before production
- **Progressive delivery** - Gradual rollouts and canary deployments
- **Multi-platform deployments** - Deploying to Kubernetes AND cloud functions
  AND VMs
- **Deployment orchestration** - Coordinating complex deployment workflows
- **Policy enforcement** - Ensuring deployment best practices are followed

## Core Entities

Ctrlplane models deployments through these key entities:

- **System** - Logical grouping of related deployments (e.g., "E-commerce
  Platform")
- **Resource** - A deployment target (e.g., a Kubernetes cluster, a VM, a
  function)
- **Environment** - A logical environment (dev, staging, prod) that groups
  resources
- **Deployment** - A service or application to deploy (e.g., "API Service")
- **Deployment Version** - A specific version/build of a deployment (e.g.,
  "v1.2.3")
- **Release Target** - The combination of (Deployment × Environment × Resource)
- **Release** - An intended deployment of a version to a release target
- **Job** - The actual deployment task executed by a job agent
- **Policy** - Rules governing deployments (approvals, progression, etc.)
