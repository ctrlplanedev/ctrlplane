  Learn how to use approval rules to require manual sign-off before deployments
  proceed.
---

**Approval rules** require manual approval from authorized users before a
deployment can proceed. This adds a human checkpoint to your deployment pipeline
for high-risk changes.

## Overview

    D --> E{Approvals Met?}
    E -->|Yes| C
    E -->|No| D
```

## Why Use Approval Rules?

Approval rules help you:

- **Add human oversight** - Require sign-off for production deployments
- **Enforce compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements for change management
- **Coordinate releases** - Ensure stakeholders are aware before deployment
- **Reduce risk** - Catch issues that automated checks might miss

## Configuration

Add an approval rule to your policy:

```hcl Terraform
resource "ctrlplane_policy" "production_approval" {
  name        = "Production Approval Policy"
  description = "Production Approval Policy"

  selector {
    environments = "environment.metadata['requires-approval'] == 'true'"
  }

  approval {
    required = 1
  }
}
```

## Properties

<ParamField path="approval.required" type="integer" required>
  Minimum number of approvals required before the deployment can proceed.
</ParamField>

## Common Patterns

### Single Approval for Production

Basic approval gate for production deployments:

```hcl Terraform
resource "ctrlplane_policy" "production_gate" {
  name        = "Production Gate Policy"
  description = "Production Gate Policy"

  selector {
    environments = "environment.metadata['requires-approval'] == 'true'"
  }

  approval {
    required = 1
  }
}
```

### Multiple Approvals for Critical Services

Require multiple sign-offs for high-risk deployments:

```hcl Terraform
resource "ctrlplane_policy" "critical_service_approval" {
  name        = "Critical Service Approval Policy"
  description = "Critical Service Approval Policy"

  selector {
    environments = "environment.metadata['requires-approval'] == 'true'"
  }

  approval {
    required = 2
  }
}
```

### Approval with Verification

Combine approval with post-deployment verification:

```hcl Terraform
resource "ctrlplane_policy" "production_full_gates" {
  name        = "Production Full Gates Policy"
  description = "Production Full Gates Policy"

  selector {
    environments = "environment.metadata['requires-approval'] == 'true'"
  }

  approval {
    required = 1
  }

  verification {
    metrics = [
      {
        name = "health-check"
        interval = "30s"
        count = 5
        provider = {
          type = "http"
          url = "http://{{.resource.name}}/health"
        }
        successCondition = "result.ok"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Approval with Gradual Rollout

Approve once, then roll out gradually:

```hcl Terraform
resource "ctrlplane_policy" "controlled_production_release" {
  name        = "Controlled Production Release Policy"
  description = "Controlled Production Release Policy"

  selector {
    environments = "environment.metadata['requires-approval'] == 'true'"
  }

  approval {
    required = 1
  }

  gradualRollout {
    rolloutType      = "linear"
    timeScaleInterval = 300 # 5 minutes between each target
  }
}
```

## Approval Workflow

### 1. Release Created

When a new release is created that matches an approval policy, it enters an
"awaiting approval" state.

### 2. Approval Requested

Users with appropriate permissions can view pending approvals in the Ctrlplane
UI or via API.

### 3. Approval Granted

Authorized users approve (or reject) the release. Each approval is recorded with
the user and timestamp.

### 4. Deployment Proceeds

Once the required number of approvals is met, the deployment continues through
any remaining policy rules.

## Best Practices

### Environment-Based Approvals

| Environment | Approvals | Notes                        |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Development | 0         | No approval needed           |
| QA          | 0         | Automated testing sufficient |
| Staging     | 0-1       | Optional for visibility      |
| Production  | 1-2       | Always require approval      |

### Recommendations

- ✅ Require approvals for production environments
- ✅ Use multiple approvals for critical services
- ✅ Combine with verification for defense in depth
- ✅ Document approval requirements in runbooks
- ✅ Set up notifications for pending approvals
