# Workspace Engine Router - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a production-ready HTTP router service in Go that automatically discovers workspace-engine workers and routes requests based on Kafka partition assignment using consistent hashing (Murmur2 algorithm).

## What Was Built

### 1. Router Service (`apps/workspace-engine-router/`)

A complete Go service with the following components:

#### Core Components

- **`main.go`**: Service entry point with OpenTelemetry tracing, graceful shutdown, and background worker cleanup
- **`pkg/config/config.go`**: Environment-based configuration
- **`pkg/registry/`**: Worker registry interface and in-memory implementation
  - `registry.go`: Interface definition
  - `memory.go`: Thread-safe in-memory implementation with TTL-based expiry
  - `types.go`: WorkerInfo struct with health checking
- **`pkg/partitioner/partitioner.go`**: Murmur2 hash implementation (consistent with Kafka)
- **`pkg/kafka/metadata.go`**: Kafka metadata client for partition count queries (with caching)
- **`pkg/proxy/proxy.go`**: HTTP reverse proxy with timeout and error handling
- **`pkg/router/`**: HTTP routing logic
  - `router.go`: Gin-based router with management and routing endpoints
  - `middleware.go`: Logging, tracing, CORS, and recovery middleware

#### Key Features

✅ **Zero-configuration worker discovery**: Workers register themselves via HTTP API
✅ **Consistent hashing**: Uses same Murmur2 algorithm as Kafka's default partitioner
✅ **Automatic failover**: TTL-based stale worker cleanup (30s default)
✅ **Interface-based registry**: Easy to swap in-memory → Postgres/Redis later
✅ **Production-ready**: Includes health checks, logging, tracing, CORS, request timeouts
✅ **OpenTelemetry support**: Full distributed tracing integration

### 2. Worker Registration Client (`apps/workspace-engine/pkg/registry/client.go`)

HTTP client library for workspace-engine workers to:

- Register with the router on startup
- Send periodic heartbeats (every 15s)
- Unregister on graceful shutdown

### 3. Workspace Engine Integration

Modified `apps/workspace-engine/`:

- **`pkg/env/env.go`**: Added `ROUTER_URL` configuration
- **`main.go`**: Integrated router registration logic
  - Auto-registers after Kafka partition assignment
  - Starts background heartbeat goroutine
  - Unregisters on shutdown

## API Endpoints

### Management API

```http
POST /api/register      # Workers register with ID, address, partitions
POST /api/heartbeat     # Workers send periodic heartbeats
POST /api/unregister    # Workers unregister on shutdown
GET  /api/workers       # List all healthy workers
GET  /healthz           # Health check with worker count
```

### Routing

```http
ANY /v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/*   # Automatically routed to correct worker
```

## Configuration

### Router Configuration (Environment Variables)

| Variable                      | Default            | Description                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `HOST`                        | `0.0.0.0`          | Host to listen on          |
| `PORT`                        | `8080`             | Port to listen on          |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS`               | `localhost:9092`   | Kafka broker addresses     |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC`                 | `workspace-events` | Kafka topic name           |
| `WORKER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`    | `30`               | Worker TTL in seconds      |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`             | `30`               | Request timeout in seconds |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | (empty)            | OpenTelemetry endpoint     |

### Worker Configuration

| Variable     | Default | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ROUTER_URL` | (empty) | Router address (e.g., `http://router:8080`) |

If `ROUTER_URL` is set, the worker will automatically register with the router.

## Architecture

The router runs **two separate HTTP servers** for complete isolation:

### Management Server (Port 9090)

- Worker registration
- Heartbeat handling
- Health checks
- Worker listing

### Routing Server (Port 8080)

- Proxies ALL requests to workers
- Extracts workspace ID from any path
- Routes based on partition calculation

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Workspace Engine Worker    │
│  (Handles partitions 0,1,2) │
└─────┬───────────────────────┘
      │
      │ POST /register (once on startup)
      │ POST /heartbeat (every 15s)
      ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Management Server :9090    │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐    │
│  │  Worker Registry    │    │
│  │  - worker-1: [0,1,2]│    │
│  │  - worker-2: [3,4,5]│    │
│  └─────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
      ▲
      │ Query for worker
      │
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Routing Server :8080       │
│                             │
│  1. Extract workspace ID    │
│  2. Hash → Partition        │
│  3. Lookup worker           │
│  4. Reverse proxy           │
└─────┬───────────────────────┘
      │
      ▼ Proxy request
┌──────────┐
│  Client  │
└──────────┘
```

**Key Benefits:**

- ✅ **Zero conflicts**: Management and routing completely isolated
- ✅ **Security**: Management port can be internal-only in K8s
- ✅ **Proxy everything**: All paths forwarded, not just `/v1/workspaces/*`

## How It Works

1. **Worker Startup**:
   - Worker starts and gets Kafka partition assignment
   - Worker POSTs to `/api/register` with its ID, HTTP address, and assigned partitions
   - Worker starts heartbeat goroutine (15s intervals)

2. **Request Routing**:
   - Client sends request to routing server: `GET http://router:8080/v1/workspaces/my-workspace/status`
   - Router extracts workspace ID from path: `my-workspace`
   - Router calculates partition: `Murmur2("my-workspace") % numPartitions`
   - Router queries registry for worker handling that partition
   - Router proxies entire request to worker's HTTP address
   - Router returns worker's response to client

3. **Health Management**:
   - Workers send heartbeats every 15 seconds
   - Router background goroutine checks for stale workers every 30 seconds
   - Workers not heartbeating for 30+ seconds are removed
   - Requests to removed workers return 503 Service Unavailable

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start the router:

```bash
cd apps/workspace-engine-router
go run main.go
```

2. Register a test worker:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workerId": "worker-1",
    "httpAddress": "http://localhost:8081",
    "partitions": [0, 1, 2]
  }'
```

3. Check workers:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workers
```

4. Test routing:

```bash
# This will route to worker-1 if workspace hashes to partition 0, 1, or 2
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/workspaces/test-workspace/status
```

### Automated Testing

Run the included test script:

```bash
./test-router.sh
```

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
# Build
docker build -t workspace-engine-router:latest \
  -f apps/workspace-engine-router/Dockerfile .

# Run

## Known Issues

1. **Pre-existing workspace-engine build issue**: The `workspacesave` handler package is imported but doesn't exist in the codebase. This is not related to the router implementation.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Postgres-backed registry for persistence across restarts
- [ ] Redis-backed registry for distributed router deployments
- [ ] Prometheus metrics (request counts, latency, worker health)
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for unhealthy workers
- [ ] Support multiple workers per partition with load balancing
- [ ] Admin UI dashboard for monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real workspace-engine workers**:

   - Start workspace-engine with `ROUTER_URL=http://localhost:8080`
   - Verify registration and routing

2. **Deploy to staging environment**:
   - Update docker-compose or Kubernetes manifests

   - Monitor logs and metrics

3. **Implement Postgres registry** (when needed):
   - Create migration for `workspace_engine_instances` table
   - Implement `PostgresRegistry` using the existing interface
   - Update router initialization to use Postgres

4. **Add metrics and monitoring**:
   - Prometheus metrics endpoint
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alerts for worker health
