 * Worker that handles environment updates.

 * 2. For all affected resources, replace the release targets based on new computations
 * 3. Recompute all policy targets' computed release targets based on the new release targets
 * 4. Add all replaced release targets to the evaluation queue
 * 5. Dispatch exit hooks for the exited resources
