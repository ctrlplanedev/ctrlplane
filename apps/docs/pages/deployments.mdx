# Deployments

Deployments are the heart of Ctrlplane. They represent the process of delivering
your software or application to various environments and targets.
Deployments encapsulate the configuration, workflows, and triggers necessary to
automate and manage the entire release process.

## Key Components

A deployment in Ctrlplane typically consists of the following elements:

- **System:** The high-level category or grouping to which the deployment
  belongs (e.g., "E-commerce," "Backend Services").
- **Release:** The specific version or build of your software to be deployed.
- **Environments:** The different stages or phases of the deployment pipeline
  (e.g., "QA," "Staging," "Production").
- **Targets:** The specific destinations where your software will be
  deployed (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, server groups, cloud functions).
- **Workflows:** The automated tasks and actions performed during the deployment
  process (e.g., running tests, deploying code, sending notifications).
- **Job Agents:** The integrations responsible for triggering your existing
  pipelines in external systems (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).
- **Policies (Optional):** Rules and constraints that govern the deployment
  process, such as requiring approvals or enforcing automated checks.

## Deployment Process

The typical deployment process in Ctrlplane involves the following steps:

- **Create a New Release:** You create a new release of your software,
  specifying the version or build number.
- **Trigger Workflows:** Ctrlplane automatically triggers the workflows
  associated with the relevant environments for that release.
- **Job Agent Activation:** The configured job agents for each deployment are
  activated, sending triggers to your external pipelines.
- **Pipeline Execution:** Your existing pipelines in GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, or
  other systems execute the necessary steps to deploy your software to the
  targeted environments and targets.
- **Deployment Status Tracking:** Ctrlplane tracks the status of each
  deployment, providing you with visibility into the progress and success of
  your releases.

  Its common to have multiple targets a single application may deploy too. It is
  best practice to have a single deployment with a pipeline that supports
  deploying to these different systems.

## Benefits of Deployments in Ctrlplane

- **Automation:** Automates the entire deployment process, reducing manual
  effort and potential for errors.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various deployment strategies, from simple linear
  pipelines to complex multi-stage workflows.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with your existing CI/CD tools and
  processes.
- **Visibility:** Provides real-time visibility into the status and progress of
  your deployments.
- **Control:** Allows you to enforce policies and approvals to ensure compliance
  and mitigate risks.

## Example

### Deploying a Web Application

You have a web application with three environments (Dev, Staging, Production)
and multiple targets (Kubernetes clusters in different regions). You
create a deployment in Ctrlplane for this application, associating it with the
correct system, environments, and targets. You also configure job agents to
trigger your GitHub Actions workflows for each environment. When you create a
new release, Ctrlplane automatically triggers the deployment process, deploying
your application to the Dev environment first, then to Staging after approval,
and finally to Production.

## Key Points

- Deployments are the core building block for automating your release process in
  Ctrlplane.
- Deployments encompass releases, environments, targets, workflows,
  and job agents.
- Ctrlplane complements your existing CI/CD tools, providing a centralized
  platform for managing deployments across different systems and environments.
- By leveraging deployments in Ctrlplane, you can achieve a streamlined,
  efficient, and reliable deployment process.
