# Ctrlplane Documentation

Welcome to Ctrlplane, an [open-source](https://github.com/sizzldev/ctrlplane)
orchestration platform designed to simplify and streamline large-scale
deployments of both software and infrastructure. Ctrlplane doesn’t aim to
replace your existing continuous deployment tools—instead, it integrates with
them, pulling everything together into one centralized platform.

Built to solve one problem exceptionally well—deploying at scale—Ctrlplane is
perfect for engineering teams managing complex multi-cloud, multi-region, or
multi-service environments. It ensures your deployments are secure, properly
tested, and fully visible across your fleet.

With Ctrlplane, you get the flexibility to set policies for security, testing,
and governance, while maintaining full control over the deployment process. It
enhances your existing workflows without the need for major changes, working
seamlessly with the CI/CD tools you already rely on—like Jenkins, GitHub
Actions, Argo, or Terraform.

The real value of Ctrlplane lies in how it simplifies managing complex
deployments, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. By centralizing
deployment management, Ctrlplane gives platform engineers a clear view of the
entire system, while empowering developers to maintain control over their
individual services.

In short, Ctrlplane is here to help you deploy at scale, making your existing
setup more efficient, secure, and easy to manage
