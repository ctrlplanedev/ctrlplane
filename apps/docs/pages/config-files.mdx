# Configuration with `*.ctrlplane.yaml`

This document explains how to define Ctrlplane constructs using a
`*.ctrlplane.yaml` file. These constructs—such as systems, deployments, and
releases—are essential for modeling your workflows and deployments. Once
defined, the YAML content can be sent in the body of a PATCH request to the
`/api/v1/config` endpoint:

```
PATCH /api/v1/config
```

## YAML Structure and Examples

A `*.ctrlplane.yaml` file allows you to structure your configurations as
follows:

```yaml
version: v1
workspace: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

systems:
  infra:
    name: infra
    description: Infrastructure system

deployments:
  infra/database:
    name: database
    description: Database deployment
    jobAgent:
      id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      config:
        repo: ctrlplane
        owner: ctrlplanedev
        workflowId: 1234567890
        installationId: 1234567890

releases:
  infra/database/0.0.1:
    name: 0.0.1
    metadata:
      id: "123"
      hello: world

  infra/database/0.0.2:
    name: 0.0.2
    metadata:
      id: "456"
      hello: galaxy

  infra/database/0.0.3:
    name: 0.0.3
    metadata:
      id: "789"
      hello: universe
```

### Version

The `version` field is required and must be set to the version of the config API
you want to use.

### Workspace

The `workspace` field is required and must be set to the ID of the workspace you
want to update resources in.

### Systems

The `systems` field is optional and contains a record of system objects. The key
is the slug of the system, and the value is the system object.

The system object has the following properties:

- `name` (optional): The name of the system.
- `description` (optional): The description of the system.

### Deployments

The `deployments` field is optional and contains a record of deployment objects.
The key is comprised of the system slug and the deployment slug, separated by a
`/` (e.g. `system-slug/deployment-slug`).

The deployment object has the following properties:

- `name` (optional): The name of the deployment.
- `description` (optional): The description of the deployment.
- `jobAgent` (optional): The job agent object for the deployment.
  - `id` (required if `jobAgent` is defined): The ID of the job agent.
  - `config` (required if `jobAgent` is defined): The configuration of the job
    agent for that deployment.

### Releases

The `releases` field is optional and contains a record of release objects. The
key is comprised of the system slug, deployment slug, and release version,
separated by `/` (e.g. `system-slug/deployment-slug/release-version`).

The release object has the following properties:

- `name` (optional): The name of the release.
- `metadata` (optional): The metadata of the release, as a record of key-value
  pairs, where the key is a string.
- `config` (optional): The configuration of the release, as a record of
  key-value pairs.

## Example CURL Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "x-api-key: $CTRLPLANE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
  -d @config.yaml \
  https://app.ctrlplane.dev/api/v1/config
```

A successful request will return a `200` status code.

## Deleting Resources

To delete a resource that was configured in a `*.ctrlplane.yaml` file, first
remove the resource from the file. This ensures that future PATCH requests will
not re-create the resource.

Then, delete the resource from the workspace in the Ctrlplane UI.
