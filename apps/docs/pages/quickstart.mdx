# Quick start

## What is Ctrlplane?

Ctrlplane is an extensible, open-source CI/CD orchestration tool that helps developers scale their deployments for multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-service software architectures.

With a wide range of out-of-the-box integrations, Ctrlplane easily connects with your existing tools and services, simplifying deployment scaling.

Using Ctrlplane, you can:

- Centralize management of multi-stage deployment pipelines across diverse environments
- Deploy to various targets (Kubernetes, cloud functions, VMs, custom infrastructure)
- Automate sophisticated processes (testing, code analysis, security scans, approval gates)
- Seamlessly integrate with popular CI tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Efficiently manage transitions between dev, test, staging, and production environments
