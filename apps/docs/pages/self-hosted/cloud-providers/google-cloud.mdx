# Installing Ctrlplane on Google Cloud Platform

It is recommended to install Ctrlplane on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using
the official Terraform/Opentofu module. You can customize it to accommodate your
needs.

If you cannot use the Terraform module, you can install Ctrlplane manually to a
GKE cluster and use the [Helm Chart](/install/helm) based install.

### Using Terraform

You can find the terraform registry module
[here](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sizzldev/ctrlplane/google/latest),
and the terraform repository
[here](https://github.com/sizzldev/terraform-google-ctrlplane).

This module creates a reslient and fault tolerant Ctrlplane installation using
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the computing environment and the following
services for storing data:

- CloudSQL for PostgreSQL
- Memorystore for Redis
- Cloud Storage

#### Usage

```hcl
module "ctrlplane" {
  source  = "sizzldev/ctrlplane/google"
  version = "x.x.x" // Use the latest version

  namespace = "ctrlplane"
}
```

After deploying the Terraform module, an IP address will be outputted. This IP
address can be used to configure DNS settings.

To output the IP address of the Ctrlplane installation, you can add the
following to your Terraform configuration:
