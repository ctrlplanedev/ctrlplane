# Job Policy Checker

The Job Policy Checker is a critical component of the ctrlplane application that
operates on a scheduled basis. Its primary functions include:

1. Running on a cron job: The checker executes at regular intervals, ensuring
   continuous monitoring and enforcement of policies.

2. Checking environment policies: It evaluates the current state of environments
   against defined policies, ensuring compliance and identifying any deviations.

3. Dispatching necessary jobs: Based on the policy checks, it automatically
   triggers and dispatches any required jobs to maintain or restore policy
   compliance.

This automated process helps maintain system integrity, ensures adherence to
defined policies, and proactively manages environments without manual
intervention.
