# Basic Authentication

This guide will help you set up basic (email/password) authentication for your
Ctrlplane application.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="warning">
  Basic authentication is not recommended for production environments. It is
  primarily intended for testing and development purposes. For production
  deployments, consider using more secure authentication methods like Google or
  OIDC.
</Callout>

## Configuration

To enable basic authentication, you need to set the following environment
variables:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used to encrypt tokens and sign cookies.

This can be generated by running:

```bash
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```

If Google or OIDC authentication is not configured, basic authentication will be
enabled by default. However, if you want to use basic authentication alongside
other methods, you must explicitly set `AUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED` to `true`.

## Usage

With basic authentication enabled, a new "Sign up" button will be displayed in
the `/login` page where users can sign up using their email and password.
