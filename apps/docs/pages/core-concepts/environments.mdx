# Environments

In Ctrlplane, environments are logical groupings of targets, essential for
structuring your CI/CD pipeline. Common examples:

- **QA**: For thorough testing and validation
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment mirroring production
- **Production**: Live environment for end-users

Benefits:

- Clear separation of deployment stages
- Efficient version management across environments
- Granular policy enforcement for environment transitions

## Environment Policies

Configurable settings to control inter-environment deployments:

- **Approval Workflows**: Implement manual gates (e.g., Staging to Production)
- **Deployment Windows**: Schedule deployments for specific timeframes
- **Rate Limiting**: Set concurrent deployment limits or caps within time
  periods
- **Version Validation**: Use regex or Semver patterns to validate deployment
  versions

## Target-Environment Association

Targets are dynamically assigned to environments using a label-based system:

1. Define labels on targets
2. Set up environment filters to match these labels
3. Upon registration, targets are automatically added to matching environments
4. Associated workflows trigger automatically

## Key Takeaways

- Environments provide structured control over the deployment pipeline
- Policies enhance governance and security for environment transitions
- Label-based system allows flexible, dynamic target-environment associations
