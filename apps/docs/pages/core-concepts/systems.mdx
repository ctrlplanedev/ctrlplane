# Systems

In Ctrlplane, a system is a high-level abstraction for organizing and managing
related deployments. It's designed to streamline your CI/CD pipelines and
enforce consistency across your infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

- **Logical Grouping:** Systems categorize deployments based on shared
  attributes or purposes.
- **Environment Standardization:** All deployments within a system use the same
  set of environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Staging, Production).
- **Policy Enforcement:** Systems apply uniform environment policies across all
  associated deployments.

## Benefits for DevOps

1. **Scalable Management:** Centralize environment and policy configurations at
   the system level, reducing overhead when managing multiple deployments.
2. **Consistent Workflows:** Ensure standardized deployment processes across
   related projects.
3. **Simplified Governance:** Implement and enforce policies uniformly across
   all deployments within a system.
4. **Efficient Onboarding:** Quickly set up new deployments with pre-configured
   environments and policies.

## Implementation

1. **System Creation:** Define a system with its required environments (e.g.,
   Dev, QA, Staging, Production).
2. **Policy Configuration:** Set up environment policies at the system level
   (e.g., approval processes, security checks, deployment windows).
3. **Deployment Association:** Link deployments to the appropriate system,
   automatically inheriting its environments and policies.

## Best Practices

- Group deployments logically based on application, team, or business function.
- Regularly review and update system-level policies to maintain security and
  compliance.
- Use systems to enforce standardization across your organization's deployment
  processes.
- Leverage system-level configurations to implement infrastructure-as-code
  principles for your CI/CD pipelines.

## Integration Points

- CI/CD Tools: Systems can be integrated with popular CI/CD tools to enforce
  policies and standardize deployment workflows.
- Infrastructure-as-Code: Use Ctrlplane's API or CLI to programmatically manage
  systems and their configurations.
- Monitoring and Logging: Implement consistent monitoring and logging practices
  across all deployments within a system.

By leveraging Ctrlplane's systems, DevOps engineers can achieve greater
consistency, scalability, and control over their deployment processes.
