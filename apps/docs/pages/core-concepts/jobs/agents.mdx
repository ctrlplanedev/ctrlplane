# Job Agents

Job agents are crucial components in Ctrlplane that facilitate the integration
between Ctrlplane and external CI/CD systems. They act as intermediaries,
enabling Ctrlplane to interact with various CI/CD tools and platforms.

## Purpose of Job Agents

The primary purposes of job agents in Ctrlplane are:

1. **Triggering Jobs:** Initiate processes in external CI/CD systems when
   Ctrlplane determines a job needs to run.
2. **Status Synchronization:** Keep the job status in Ctrlplane updated with the
   latest information from the external system.
3. **Cross-Platform Integration:** Enable Ctrlplane to work with multiple CI/CD
   tools seamlessly.

## How Job Agents Work

1. **Job Initiation:** When Ctrlplane determines a job needs to run (e.g., due
   to a new release or target addition), it communicates with the appropriate
   job agent.
2. **External System Interaction:** The job agent then triggers the
   corresponding job in the external CI/CD system using that system's API or
   other integration methods.
3. **Status Monitoring:** The job agent continuously or periodically checks the
   status of the job in the external system.
4. **Status Updates:** As the job progresses, the agent reports status changes
   back to Ctrlplane, ensuring the Ctrlplane dashboard reflects the current
   state of all jobs.

## Types of Job Agents

Ctrlplane supports various job agents to integrate with popular CI/CD tools,
including:

- GitHub Actions Agent
- GitLab CI/CD Agent
- Jenkins Agent
- Kubernetes Jobs Agent
- Argo Workflows Agent
- Custom Job Agents (for integrating with other CI/CD tools)

## Benefits of Using Job Agents

1. **Unified View:** Job agents allow Ctrlplane to provide a centralized view of
   all deployment activities across different CI/CD platforms.
2. **Automation:** They enable automatic job triggering based on various events
   in Ctrlplane.
3. **Flexibility:** Support for multiple job agents allows organizations to use
   their preferred CI/CD tools while still benefiting from Ctrlplane's
   orchestration capabilities.
4. **Scalability:** As your CI/CD ecosystem grows, you can add new job agents to
   integrate with additional tools.

## Best Practices for Job Agents

1. **Regular Updates:** Keep job agents updated to ensure compatibility with
   both Ctrlplane and the external CI/CD systems.
2. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for job agents to ensure they're
   functioning correctly and to quickly identify any issues.
3. **Security:** Ensure that job agents have the necessary permissions to
   interact with external systems, but follow the principle of least privilege.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in job agents to manage
   potential issues with external system communication.

By leveraging job agents effectively, you can create a seamless integration
between Ctrlplane and your existing CI/CD tools, enabling more sophisticated and
coordinated deployment strategies across your entire infrastructure.
