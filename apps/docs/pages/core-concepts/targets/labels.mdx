# Target Labels

Target labels in Ctrlplane are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to
categorize and organize your deployment targets. They play a crucial role in
defining deployment strategies, filtering targets, and applying configurations
selectively.

## Understanding Target Labels

Labels are metadata attached to targets, allowing you to group and select
targets based on various criteria. They are particularly useful for:

- Organizing targets by environment, region, or purpose
- Applying configurations to specific groups of targets
- Filtering targets for deployment or management tasks
- Applying variable values to specific targets during deployment

## How Labels Work in Ctrlplane

1. **Definition**: Labels are defined as key-value pairs on individual targets.
2. **Flexibility**: You can assign multiple labels to a single target.
3. **Querying**: Ctrlplane allows you to query and filter targets based on their
   labels.
4. **Selective Application**: Use labels to apply configurations or run
   deployments on specific subsets of targets.

## Examples of Target Labels

Here are some common examples of how you might use labels in Ctrlplane:

```yaml
environment: production
region: us-west
role: web-server
tier: frontend
---
environment: staging
region: eu-central
role: database
tier: backend
```

## Best Practices for Using Labels

1. **Consistency**: Establish a consistent labeling scheme across your
   organization.
2. **Granularity**: Use labels that provide the right level of detail for your
   needs.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your label taxonomy.
4. **Avoid Overloading**: Don't try to encode too much information in a single
   label.
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update your labeling strategy as
   your infrastructure evolves.

By effectively using target labels in Ctrlplane, you can create more flexible,
manageable, and scalable deployment strategies that adapt to your organization's
evolving needs.
