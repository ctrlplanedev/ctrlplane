# Target Metadata

Target metadata in Ctrlplane are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to
categorize and organize your deployment targets. They play a crucial role in
defining deployment strategies, filtering targets, and applying configurations
selectively.

## Understanding Target Metadata

Metadata is attached to targets, allowing you to group and select
targets based on various criteria. They are particularly useful for:

- Organizing targets by environment, region, or purpose
- Applying configurations to specific groups of targets
- Filtering targets for deployment or management tasks
- Applying variable values to specific targets during deployment

## How Metadata Works in Ctrlplane

1. **Definition**: Metadata are defined as key-value pairs on individual targets.
2. **Flexibility**: You can assign multiple key-value pairs to a single target.
3. **Querying**: Ctrlplane allows you to query and filter targets based on their
   metadata.
4. **Selective Application**: Use metadata to apply configurations or run
   deployments on specific subsets of targets.

## Examples of Target Metadata

Here are some common examples of how you might use metadata in Ctrlplane:

```yaml
environment: production
region: us-west
role: web-server
tier: frontend
---
environment: staging
region: eu-central
role: database
tier: backend
```

## Best Practices for Using Metadata

1. **Consistency**: Establish a consistent metadata scheme across your
   organization.
2. **Granularity**: Use metadata that provide the right level of detail for your
   needs.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your metadata taxonomy.
4. **Avoid Overloading**: Don't try to encode too much information in a single
   metadata key.
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update your metadata strategy as
   your infrastructure evolves.

By effectively using target metadata in Ctrlplane, you can create more flexible,
manageable, and scalable deployment strategies that adapt to your organization's
evolving needs.
