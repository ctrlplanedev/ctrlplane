# Workflow

In Ctrlplane, **workflows** represent the execution of your existing deployment
pipelines. Ctrlplane does not aim to replace your existing pipeline tools (e.g.,
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins); instead, it complements them by
providing a powerful trigger mechanism and integrations.

Workflows can be automatically triggered by various events within Ctrlplane:

- **New Releases:** When you create a new release of your software, Ctrlplane
  can trigger workflows to deploy that release to specific environments.
- **New Targets:** The addition of new targets (e.g., a
  newly discovered Kubernetes cluster) can initiate workflows to deploy your
  software to that target.
- **Target Updates:** If a target changes (e.g., a
  configuration update), Ctrlplane can trigger workflows to re-deploy your
  software or perform other necessary actions.

## Job Agents

Job agents are the core of Ctrlplane's integration capabilities. They are
responsible for triggering your existing pipelines in external systems.
Ctrlplane supports a variety of job agents for popular CI/CD platforms,
allowing you to seamlessly integrate with your preferred tools.

Each deployment in Ctrlplane can be configured with one job agents. This means
you can tailor your triggers and workflows to the specific requirements of each
deployment.

## How It Works

1. **Configuration:** When setting up your deployment, you select and configure
   the appropriate jobs. This involves specifying the provider (e.g.,
   GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins), credentials, and any other necessary details.
2. **Trigger Event:** When a trigger event occurs (e.g., new release, new
   target), Ctrlplane identifies the relevant deployments and their associated
   job agents.
3. **Job Agent Activation:** Ctrlplane activates the configured job agents,
   sending the necessary information to trigger the corresponding pipelines in
   your external systems.
4. **Pipeline Execution:** Your existing pipelines run as they normally would,
   deploying your software, running tests, or performing other actions defined
   within your pipeline.

## Key Points

- Workflows in Ctrlplane represent the execution of your existing pipelines.
- Job Agents enable seamless integration with various CI/CD platforms.
- Each deployment can be configured with specific job agents to tailor the
  triggering mechanism.

Ctrlplane complements your existing pipelines, providing a powerful trigger
mechanism and centralized management.
