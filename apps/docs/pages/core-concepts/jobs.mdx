# Jobs

Jobs in Ctrlplane represent external running processes, typically integrating
with your existing CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Kubernetes
Jobs, Argo Workflows, and others. These jobs reflect the status of processes
running in external systems, providing a centralized view of your deployment
activities across various platforms.

## Purpose of Jobs in Ctrlplane

The primary purpose of jobs in Ctrlplane is to:

1. Reflect the status of external processes
2. Provide a unified view of deployment activities
3. Enable orchestration and coordination across different CI/CD tools

It's important to note that Ctrlplane is not meant to replace your existing
CI/CD tools, but rather to complement them by providing additional orchestration
capabilities.

## Job Creation Triggers

Jobs in Ctrlplane can be created by various events:

- New releases
- New resources added to an environment
- Changes in filtering labels of an environment or resource
- Manual intervention
- Triggering of a runbook

## Job Agents

Job agents are the key components that facilitate the integration between
Ctrlplane and external CI/CD systems. When a job needs to be triggered,
Ctrlplane uses the appropriate job agent to initiate the process in the
underlying CI/CD tool.

Job agents are responsible for:

1. Triggering jobs in the external system
2. Keeping the job status in Ctrlplane synchronized with the external system

## Benefits of Using Ctrlplane for Job Management

While it's recommended to use the native interfaces of your CI/CD tools for
real-time information, Ctrlplane offers several advantages:

1. **Centralized View:** Ctrlplane provides a unified interface to monitor jobs
   across different CI/CD platforms.
2. **Advanced Orchestration:** Based on configured policies, resources, and
   environments, Ctrlplane can orchestrate complex deployment scenarios that may
   involve multiple CI/CD systems.
3. **Automated Triggering:** Ctrlplane can automatically trigger jobs based on
   various events, reducing manual intervention.
4. **Cross-Platform Coordination:** Ctrlplane can coordinate jobs across
   different CI/CD platforms, enabling more complex deployment strategies.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Native Tools for Detailed Monitoring:** While Ctrlplane provides status
   updates, use the native interfaces of your CI/CD tools for detailed,
   real-time information about job execution.
2. **Leverage Ctrlplane for Orchestration:** Use Ctrlplane's features to
   orchestrate complex deployment scenarios that involve multiple systems or
   stages.
3. **Regular Synchronization:** Ensure that your job agents are configured to
   regularly synchronize status information between Ctrlplane and your CI/CD
   tools.

By leveraging jobs and job agents in Ctrlplane, you can streamline your
deployment processes, gain better visibility across your CI/CD landscape, and
implement more sophisticated deployment strategies that span multiple tools and
platforms.
