# Resource Metadata

Resource metadata in Ctrlplane are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way
to categorize and organize your deployment resources. They play a crucial role
in defining deployment strategies, filtering resources, and applying
configurations selectively.

## Configs vs Metadata

In Ctrlplane, it's important to understand the distinction between configs and
metadata, as they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.
This distinction is similar to the difference between the `spec` and `metadata`
sections in Kubernetes.

### Configs

Configs are essential for interacting with the resource and should be
standardized across all types of resources. This standardization ensures that if
the same pipeline is given two different resources of the same kind, it can use
the properties in the config to interact with them consistently.

In some cases, you might need additional data outside the standard context to
determine how to interact with the resource. In such scenarios, it is acceptable
to include this extra data in the config, but it should be limited to variants
of a given resource and should not impact the primary configuration or behavior.

In Ctrlplane, configs are used within CI/CD pipelines to interact with
resources. They define how to deploy or provision the resource. It is crucial
that values in the config are used to guide these interactions and not to store
arbitrary metadata.

**Examples of Configs:**

This is how the kubernetes schema currently defines interacting to a kubernetes
cluster. Thes properties are required for a pipeline to connect to clusters.

```yaml
name: my-kubernetes-cluster
cluster:
  endpoint: https://...
  certificateAuthorityData: ...
```

For clusters hosted on Google Cloud (or any cloud provider), you might want to
include metadata about the project associated with the cluster. This metadata
can then be used in the pipeline to generate the necessary access token for
authenticating with the cluster.

### Metadata

Metadata in Ctrlplane is used to provide additional information about a
resource. It consists of key-value pairs that help categorize and organize
resources. Metadata is not used to define the behavior or configuration of the
resource but rather to describe it.

**Examples of Metadata:**

- `region: us-west`
- `role: web-server`
- `tier: frontend`

**When to Use Metadata:**

- To group resources by specific attributes (e.g., environment, region).
- To filter and select resources for deployment or management tasks.
- To apply variable values to specific resources during deployment.
- To provide descriptive information that helps in organizing and querying
  resources.

### Summary

- **Metadata**: Descriptive information used for categorization, organization,
  and filtering. It does not affect the resource's behavior.
- **Configs**: Operational parameters and desired state definitions that dictate
  how the resource should function, used in CI/CD pipelines for interacting with
  resources.

By understanding the difference between metadata and configs, you can
effectively organize and manage your deployment resources in Ctrlplane, ensuring
that each resource is properly described and configured according to your
requirements.

## Understanding Resource Metadata

Metadata is attached to resources, allowing you to group and select resources
based on various criteria. They are particularly useful for:

- Organizing resources by environment, region, or purpose
- Applying configurations to specific groups of resources
- Filtering resources for deployment or management tasks
- Applying variable values to specific resources during deployment

## How Metadata Works in Ctrlplane

1. **Definition**: Metadata are defined as key-value pairs on individual
   resources.
2. **Flexibility**: You can assign multiple key-value pairs to a single
   resource.
3. **Querying**: Ctrlplane allows you to query and filter resources based on
   their metadata.
4. **Selective Application**: Use metadata to apply configurations or run
   deployments on specific subsets of resources.

## Examples of Resource Metadata

Here are some common examples of how you might use metadata in Ctrlplane:

```yaml
environment: production
region: us-west
role: web-server
tier: frontend
---
environment: staging
region: eu-central
role: database
tier: backend
```

## Best Practices for Using Metadata

1. **Consistency**: Establish a consistent metadata scheme across your
   organization.
2. **Granularity**: Use metadata that provide the right level of detail for your
   needs.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your metadata taxonomy.
4. **Avoid Overloading**: Don't try to encode too much information in a single
   metadata key.
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update your metadata strategy as
   your infrastructure evolves.

By effectively using resource metadata in Ctrlplane, you can create more
flexible, manageable, and scalable deployment strategies that adapt to your
organization's evolving needs.

## Special Labels

In Ctrlplane, we have special labels that can be added to resources to enhance
the user experience in the UI. These labels do not change the core functionality
of Ctrlplane but provide additional features and visual cues for better
usability.

| Label                          | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctrlplane/links`              | Provides a set of links related to the resource. The value should be a JSON object where the keys are the link names and the values are the URLs. |
| `ctrlplane/created-by-job-id`  | UUID of the Ctrlplane Job that created the resource.                                                                                              |
| `ctrlplane/external-id`        | An external identifier for the resource, which can be used to correlate the resource with resources in other systems.                             |
| `ctrlplane/cloud-platform`     | The cloud platform the resource is running on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).                                                                            |
| `ctrlplane/region`             | The geographical region or data center location where the resource is deployed.                                                                   |
| `ctrlplane/parent-resource-id` | The UUID of the parent resource, if the resource is a child resource of another resource.                                                         |
