# Overview

Ctrlplane is a centralized, scalable deployment management system designed to
simplify and automate software deployments. At the core of Ctrlplane are several
key components that work together to ensure smooth operations.

**Targets** are entities such as Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, or other
logical resources, that the system interacts with. These targets can be added
manually or through **Target Providers**, which automate the process by
continuously monitoring infrastructure, updating target statuses, and providing
real-time visibility. Targets are organized into **Environments**, which
dynamically update based on target filters, ensuring the right infrastructure is
always in place for deployments.

Once targets and environments are established, **Deployments** come into play. A
deployment is the process of releasing a specific version of a system into an
environment. Each deployment is governed by **Environment Policies**, which
manage how software transitions between environments. When a release is created,
it generates a **Job**, which is executed by **Job Agents** that handle tasks
like running CI/CD pipelines. In addition, Ctrlplane supports **Runbooks**,
predefined jobs that automate routine tasks like troubleshooting or maintenance,
providing further automation and reliability. Together, these components form an
integrated system for managing software releases and operational tasks in a
streamlined, efficient way.
