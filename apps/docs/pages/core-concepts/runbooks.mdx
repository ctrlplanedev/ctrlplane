# Runbooks

Runbooks in Ctrlplane are a specialized type of deployment designed to automate
common tasks and workflows that are not necessarily tied to specific
environments. Think of runbooks as your automated playbooks for operational
procedures, incident response, maintenance tasks, and other recurring
activities.

## Key Characteristics

- **Environment Agnostic:** Unlike deployments, runbooks do not directly
  interact with environments. They focus on executing specific tasks or
  workflows independently.
- **Flexible Triggers:** Runbooks can be triggered in multiple ways:
  - **Manually:** Through the Ctrlplane UI or API.
  - **API:** Programmatically from external systems or scripts.
  - **Scheduled:** On a predefined schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Reusable Workflows:** Runbooks can encapsulate complex workflows, making
  them easy to reuse and share across different contexts.

## Use Cases

Runbooks are ideal for a variety of scenarios, including:

- **Incident Response:** Automate troubleshooting steps, data collection, and
  communication during incidents.
- **Maintenance Tasks:** Schedule routine tasks like backups, log rotations, and
  system health checks.
- **Operational Procedures:** Automate repetitive manual tasks like user
  provisioning, database maintenance, or infrastructure updates.
- **Testing and Validation:** Trigger automated tests and validation suites on
  demand or on a schedule.

## How Runbooks Work

- **Creation:** Runbooks are created similarly to deployments, defining the
  workflows to be executed.
- **Trigger Configuration:** You configure the triggers for each runbook,
  specifying whether it should be triggered manually, via API, or on a schedule.
- **Workflow Execution:** When a runbook is triggered, Ctrlplane executes the
  associated workflows, performing the defined actions.

## Key Points

- Runbooks are versatile tools for automating a wide range of tasks.
- Runbooks are not tied to specific environments, giving you more flexibility in
  their use.
- Runbooks can be triggered manually, via API, or on a schedule.
