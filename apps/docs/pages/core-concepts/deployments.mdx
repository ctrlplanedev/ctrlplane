# Understanding Deployments in Ctrlplane

Deployments in Ctrlplane are the central organizing principle for managing and
orchestrating the release of your software or infrastructure across various
environments within a system. A deployment represents a complete, end-to-end process
for delivering changes to your system, encompassing everything from the initial
code commit to the final production release.

## What is a Deployment?

A deployment in Ctrlplane is:

1. **A Logical Unit**: It typically represents a single service, application, or
   piece of infrastructure.

2. **System-Bound**: Each deployment is assigned to a specific system, which contains
   multiple environments (e.g., QA, Staging, Production). When you create a deployment,
   it automatically becomes part of all environments within that system.

3. **Version Control**: It manages multiple releases (versions) of your software
   or infrastructure configuration.

4. **Pipeline Definition**: It includes a defined CI/CD pipeline that outlines
   the steps for building, testing, and deploying your changes.

5. **Release Manager**: It groups and organizes releases, providing a historical
   view of all deployments.

## Key Components of a Deployment

A deployment in Ctrlplane typically includes:

1. **Releases**: Individual versions of your software or infrastructure
   configuration.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: The defined process for deploying releases.

3. **System and Environment Association**: The deployment is part of all
   environments within its assigned system, allowing for consistent deployment
   across different stages.

4. **Job Configurations**: Specifications for the jobs that will be created and
   run for each release and target.

5. **Variables**: Target-specific variables that allow the same pipeline to
   be used across different environments.

## Systems, Environments, and Target Filtering

Ctrlplane uses a hierarchical structure to manage deployments:

1. **Systems**: The top-level organizational unit. A system contains multiple
   environments and is associated with one or more deployments.

2. **Environments**: Subsets of a system (e.g., QA, Staging, Production). Each
   environment can be configured with specific settings and policies.

3. **Environment Configuration**: Each environment is configured with label
   filters to determine which targets fall under that environment. This allows
   for fine-grained control over where deployments are applied.

4. **Target Filtering**: When a release is created, Ctrlplane uses the
   environment's label filters to identify matching targets. It then runs the
   appropriate jobs for each of these targets.

5. **Inter-Environment Policies**: Environments are connected by policies that
   determine when and how jobs should run. These policies control the
   progression of deployments through environments (e.g., from Staging to
   Production).

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Deployment Creation**: A deployment is created and assigned to a system.

2. **Release Initiation**: A new release is created within the deployment.

3. **Environment Processing**: For each environment in the system:

   - The environment's label filters are applied to identify relevant targets.
   - Jobs are created for each matching target based on the deployment's job
     definitions.

4. **Policy Enforcement**: Inter-environment policies determine when jobs can
   run, allowing for controlled progression through environments.

5. **Job Execution**: Jobs are executed on the identified targets, applying the
   release changes.

## Creating and Managing Deployments

Deployments can be created and managed in two primary ways:

1. **Manual Creation**: Through the Ctrlplane UI or API, specifying the system
   it belongs to.

2. **Automated Creation**: By including a `.ctrlplane.yaml` file in your Git
   repository. This method allows for automatic deployment creation when new
   repositories are added, with system assignment specified in the configuration.

Example `.ctrlplane.yaml`:
