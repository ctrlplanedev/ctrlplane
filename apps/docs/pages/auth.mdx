# Authentication

Ctrlplane supports multiple authentication methods to secure your application.

## Available Authentication Methods

import { Cards } from "nextra/components";
import { RiLockPasswordLine } from "react-icons/ri";
import { SiAuth0, SiGoogle } from "react-icons/si";

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<SiGoogle className="h-8 w-8" />}
    title="Google"
    href="/auth/google"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<SiAuth0 className="h-8 w-8" />}
    title="OIDC"
    href="/auth/oidc"
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<RiLockPasswordLine className="h-8 w-8" />}
    title="Basic Auth"
    href="/auth/basic"
  />
</Cards>

Please see the individual sections for detailed information on how to set up
each authentication method, including the required environment variables and
configuration steps.

## General Configuration

Regardless of the authentication method you choose, you'll need to set the
following environment variable:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used to encrypt tokens and sign cookies.

This can be generated by running:

```bash
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Authentication Priority

It's important to note that if Google or OIDC authentication is configured,
basic (credentials) authentication will be disabled by default. If you want to
enable basic authentication alongside other methods, you need to explicitly set
`AUTH_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED` to `true`.

## Next Steps

Choose the authentication method that best suits your needs and follow the setup
instructions in the respective section. Each authentication method has its own
requirements and configuration steps, so be sure to review the documentation
carefully.
