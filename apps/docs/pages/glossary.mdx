# Glossary

**Deployment:** The core process of delivering software or applications to
various environments and resources.

**Resource:** A specific destination or context where actions are performed
during a deployment. This can be infrastructure like an EKS cluster or a more
abstract concept like a custom object.

**Environment:** A logical grouping of resources representing distinct stages in
the software release process (e.g., QA, Staging, Production).

**Environment Policy:** Configurable settings that govern how deployments move
from one environment to another, including approvals, automated checks, and
rollback strategies.

**Metadata:** A tag assigned to a resource, used for filtering and organizing.

**Release:** A specific version or build of the software to be deployed.

**Runbook:** A type of deployment designed to automate common tasks and
workflows, independent of specific environments. Can be triggered manually, via
API, or on a schedule.

**Resource Provider:** An automated process that discovers, registers, and
updates resources by monitoring infrastructure and external systems.

**System:** A high-level category for grouping deployments that share common
characteristics like environments and policies.

**Workflow:** The automated tasks and actions performed during the deployment
process, often executed in external systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD,
or Jenkins.

**Job Agent:** The integration component responsible for triggering workflows in
external systems.
