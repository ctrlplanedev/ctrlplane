# Jobs Agent

The Kubernetes Job Agent seamlessly integrates with your Kubernetes clusters,
enabling you to trigger Kubernetes Jobs directly from within Ctrlplane. It
responds to events like new software releases, new target discoveries, or
updates to existing targets. This powerful integration allows you to leverage
Ctrlplane's flexible management capabilities while harnessing the robust job
execution capabilities of Kubernetes.

- **Job Creation:** Dynamically creates Kubernetes Jobs based on predefined
  templates or specifications.
- **Handlebars for Templating:** Utilizes Handlebars templating to dynamically
  generate Kubernetes Job manifests.
