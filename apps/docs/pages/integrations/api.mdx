# API

API keys can be used to integrate Scanners, register Releases from continuous
delivery pipelines, or interact with Ctrlplane programmatically. They are
essential for automating workflows, integrating with external tools like the
[Terraform Cloud Scanner](./terraform-cloud/scanner) or
[GitHub Actions Dispatcher](./github/actions-dispatcher), and building custom
integrations with your existing infrastructure management systems.

Dirrect API access can be configured by navigating to

```bash
https://${CTRLPLANE_BASE_URL}/${WORKSPACE_SLUG}/ettings/account/api
```

to create a key.

## Creating an API Key

To create a new API key, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the API section in your account settings.
2. Enter a name for your API key in the "Name" field.
3. Click on the "Create new API key" button.

<Callout type="info">
  Once the API key is generated, it will only be shown once. Make sure to copy
  it and store it securely, as you will not be able to view it again.
</Callout>

## Revoking an API Key

If you no longer need an API key or suspect it has been compromised, you can
revoke it at any time. To revoke an API key:

1. Locate the API key you wish to revoke in the API section.
2. Click the "Revoke" button next to the corresponding key.

<Callout type="info">
  This action will immediately disable the API key, preventing any further
  access using that key.
</Callout>
