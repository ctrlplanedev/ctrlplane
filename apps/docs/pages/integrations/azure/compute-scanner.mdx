# Azure Compute Scanner

The Azure Compute Scanner is a tool that scans Azure subscriptions for resources
and creates corresponding resources in Ctrlplane. It will keep resources in
sync, creating and deleting resources as they are created and deleted in Azure.

Currently the Azure Compute Scanner supports importing the following resources:

- Azure Kubernetes Service Clusters (AKS)

## Managed Compute Scanner on SaaS

The managed Azure Compute Scanner is built into the Ctrlplane solution. In order
to configure it, you must consent to our Azure AD application in your Azure
tenant and give it the necessary permissions to scan your Azure resources.

### Configure the scanner in Ctrlplane

Visit the Resource Provider Integrations page which can be found at

`https://app.ctrlplane.dev/{workspace-slug}/resource-providers/integrations`.

Click on the `Configure` button in the Azure card. Fill in the name of the
scanner, the tenant ID of your Azure tenant, and the subscription ID of the
Azure subscription.

Once a tenant has been configured in a workspace, it cannot be added to another
workspace. However, you can add multiple tenants to a workspace, and the same
tenant can be used for multiple scanners within the same workspace (for example
adding multiple scanners for different subscriptions).

### Consent to the Azure AD application

Once you have configured the scanner in Ctrlplane, you will be redirected to the
Azure portal. You will need to consent to the Azure AD application by clicking
on the `Accept` button. Once consent is granted, you will be redirected back to
Ctrlplane for the next steps.

The next steps page will outline how to grant permissions to the Azure AD
application to scan your Azure resources. Those instructions are also available
below.

### Grant permissions to the Azure AD application (Next Steps)

Navigate to the IAM page for your subscription at

`https://portal.azure.com/#@{tenant-id}/resource/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/users`

There is also a redirect link to the portal in the next steps page.

Next, click on the `Add role assignment` button.

Once selected, click on the `Review + assign` button. Verify the role assignment
and click on the `Review + assign` button again to complete the process.

Once the role assignmet is completed, return to the next steps page and click
`Permissions granted`. The setup process is complete.

You will be redirected to your workspace's Resource Providers page, where you
can see the Azure Compute Scanner.
