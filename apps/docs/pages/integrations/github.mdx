# Github Integration

Connect your Github organization to your workspace to enable several powerful
features, including

- Github Job Agent
- Release Scanner
- Deployment Configuration

## Instance Level Integration

Configuring the Github integration at the instance level will enable it for all
workspaces on that instance. However, you can optionally configure the
integration at the workspace level to override the instance level configuration.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>
### On Github, create a new Github App

To set this up, navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/) and register a new
GitHub App.

- Your GitHub account: https://github.com/settings/apps/new
- Your GitHub organization:
  `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/apps/new`

### Configure the Github App

Fill out the form as follows:

| Field           | Value                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Github App Name | ctrlplane-`{your-instance-name}`                      |
| Homepage URL    | `https://ctrlplane.dev` (or the URL of your instance) |
| Webhook URL     | \<your-instance-url\>/api/github/webhook              |

Configure the permissions as follows:

import { TbArrowRight } from "react-icons/tb";

#### Repository Permissions

- `Actions: Read and write` <TbArrowRight className="inline-block" /> Allows the
  creation of workflow runs associated with your deployments.
- `Contents: Read only` <TbArrowRight className="inline-block" /> Allows
  Ctrlplane to detect changes to your `*ctrlplane.yaml` configuration files.
  Read more about [configuration management](/github/deployment-configs).

#### Organization Permissions

- `Members: Read only` <TbArrowRight className="inline-block" /> Allows you to
  configure github organizations across your workspaces.

### Subscribe to Events

- `Push` <TbArrowRight className="inline-block" /> Subscribe to push events to
  sync changes to your deployment configurations.

### Extra configurations

#### Where can this Github App be installed?

You can choose the scope of this installation. Selecting "Only on this account"
will only allow the instance level integration access to your current account.

### Create the Github App

### Configure the Github information on your instance

#### Create a new client secret

Copy or note down the client secret, as it will be used to configure the Github
App.

#### Generate a new private key

The private key is used to sign access token requests, which allow Ctrlplane to
sync changes from your `ctrlplane.yaml` files. Once created, the private key
will automatically be downloaded - note the location of the file.

#### Helm Chart Installation

In your `values.yaml`, add the following:

```yaml
global:
  integrations:
    github:
      url: https://ctrlplane.dev
      bot:
        appName: ctrlplane-bot
        appId: 1234567890
        clientId: 1234567890
        clientSecret: 1234567890
        privateKey: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...`

```

#### Terraform Installation

In your `terraform.tfvars`, add the following:

```hcl
# The name of the Github App
GITHUB_BOT_APP_NAME = "ctrlplane-bot"

# The ID of the Github App, can be found in the "about" section
# of the Github App
GITHUB_BOT_APP_ID = "1234567890"

# The client ID of the Github App, can be found in the "about"
# section of the Github App
GITHUB_BOT_CLIENT_ID = "1234567890"

# The client secret of the Github App
GITHUB_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET = "1234567890"

# The private key of the Github App, can be copied from the
# downloaded file
GITHUB_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----..."
```

### Finish the configuration in Ctrlplane

1. Navigate to the github integration page in the workspace settings

   ```js
   {your-instance-url}/settings/workspace/integrations/github
   ```

2. Connect your personal account

3. Select or add a Github organization to link to your workspace.

Once you have connected a github organization, you will unlock several features:

- Any `ctrlplane.yaml` files in the organization (that were allowed access
  during installation) will be automatically synced to your workspace
- You can use the Github Job Agent associate a Github Action with a deployment
- You can use the Release Scanner to scan for releases in your organization and
  create corresponding releases in Ctlrplane
