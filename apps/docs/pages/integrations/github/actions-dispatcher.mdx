# Actions Dispatcher

GitHub Actions Dispatcher allows you to trigger other GitHub Actions workflows
from a single workflow. This is useful when you want to run multiple workflows
in parallel or trigger a workflow from another repository.

## Creating Actions

<Callout type="info">
  Due to [limitations of the GitHub API](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/9752), workflows do not return the run ID. In order for Ctrl Plane to get the ID, it generates a random one that is passed into the pipeline and is expected to be added to the Run name. This can be done by adding:

```yaml
name: Receiving Workflow
run-name:
  Receiving Workflow [${{ inputs.distinct_id && inputs.distinct_id || 'N/A' }}]

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      distinct_id:
        description: "Distinct ID"
        required: false
```

</Callout>

### Configuring Workflows with Ctrl Plane

To integrate Ctrl Plane's `get-job-inputs` action into a workflow, follow the
steps below. This action allows you to pass job inputs like `release_version`
and `resource_config_deployment_id` to your workflows.

First, ensure the workflow can be triggered by a dispatch event:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      job_id:
        description: "Job execution ID"
        required: true
```

Next, configure the action to retrieve job inputs from Ctrl Plane using the
`get-job-inputs` action. You will need to provide the base URL of your Ctrl
Plane instance, the `job_id` (input), and an API key stored in your GitHub
secrets.

Example configuration:

```yaml
jobs:
  set-deployment-spec:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - id: ctrlplane
        uses: ctrlplanedev/ctrlplane/github/get-job-inputs@main
        with:
          base_url: https://ctrlplane.dev
          job_id: ${{ inputs.job_id }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.CTRLPLANE_API_KEY }}
          required_outputs: |
            release_version
            resource_config_deployment_id
```

This example shows how the workflow retrieves specific values, such as
`release_version` and `resource_config_deployment_id`, to be used in subsequent
steps. The action integrates seamlessly with Ctrl Plane to ensure the proper
data is fetched and utilized within your pipeline.

### Key Steps to Integrate:

1. Use `workflow_dispatch` to allow manual triggering.
2. Pass the necessary `job_id` input when dispatching.
3. Ensure the `get-job-inputs` action is correctly configured with the
   `base_url`, `job_id`, and `CTRLPLANE_API_KEY` as shown above.
4. Specify the required outputs that will be used in your workflow.
