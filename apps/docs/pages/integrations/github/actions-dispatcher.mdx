# Actions Dispatcher

GitHub Actions Dispatcher is allows you to trigger other GitHub Actions
workflows from a single workflow. This is useful when you want to run multiple
workflows in parallel or when you want to trigger a workflow from another
repository.

## Creating Actions

<Callout type="info">
  Due to [limitations of the GitHub
  API](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/9752), workflows do not
  return the run ID. Inorder for Ctrl Plane to get the ID it generates a random
  one that is passed into the pipeline and is expected to be added to the Run
  name. This can be done by adding

```yaml
name: Receiving Workflow
run-name: Receiving Workflow [${{ inputs.distinct_id && inputs.distinct_id || 'N/A' }}]

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      distinct_id:
        description: "Distinct ID"
        required: false
```

</Callout>

### Configuring a workflows

Each provider will make there own assmputions about how values and properties
are expected to be passed to the underlying workflow. In this section we will
outline the format inwhich data will be passed in.

First, the workflow must be able to be triggered by a dispatch.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```
