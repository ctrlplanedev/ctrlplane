# Compute Scanner

The Compute Scanner is a tool that scans Google Cloud projects for new instances
and creates them for related deployments automatically.

Currently the compute scanner supports importing the following resources:

- Google Kubernetes Engine Clusters (GKE)
  - Namespaces
  - VClusters (Virtual Clusters)
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)

## Managed Compute Scanner

The managed Compute Scanner is built into the Ctrlplane solution. Each workspace
will be assigned a google service account. You need to invite this service
account to your projects and resources you would like it to scan. Then in the
UI, you can add a new provider, select the managed install and add all the
projects you will like it to scan. Once you hit submit you may need to wait a
few mins while it scanns and imports all compute resources.

You will need to navigate to `workspace/integrations/google` to enable the
integration and find your unique service account.

```bash
ctrlplane-${workspace-slug}@ctrlplane-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

For the scanner to function correctly, you will need to grant the following
viewer permissions to this service account depending on what resources you want
to scan in:

| Resource Type                  | Required Role                 |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) | `roles/container.viewer`      |
| VMs (Virtual Machines)         | `roles/compute.viewer`        |
| VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds)  | `roles/compute.networkViewer` |

We higly recommend using IAC to manage your permissions, but for the brave, here
is a way to quickly get started:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project-id} \
    --member=serviceAccount:ctrlplane-${workspace-slug}@ctrlplane-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=${role}
```

## Unmanaged Compute Scanner

The unmanaged Compute Scanner is a standalone tool that can be run in your
infrastrcuture. Similar to the managed solution, it imports all compute
resources from your projects. The unmanaged scanner is a docker container that
can be run in your infrastructure. You will need to provide the service account
credentials to the container.

You may want to use the unmanaged solution when you want fine control over the
scanner.
