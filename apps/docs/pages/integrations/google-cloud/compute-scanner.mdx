# Compute Scanner

The Compute Scanner is a tool that scans Google Cloud projects for new instances
and creates them for related deployments automatically.

Currently the compute scanner supports importing the following resources:

- Google Kubernetes Engine Clusters (GKE)

## Managed Compute Scanner

The managed Compute Scanner is build into the Ctrlplane solution. Each workspace
will is assigned a google service account. You need to invite this service
account to your projects you would like it to scan. Then in the UI, you can add
a new provider, select the managed install and add all the projects you will
like it to scale. Once you hit submit you may need to wait a few mins while it
scanns and imports all compute resources.

## Unmanaged Compute Scanner

The unmanaged Compute Scanner is a standalone tool that can be run in your
infrastrcuture. Similar to the managed solution, it imports all compute
resources from your projects. The unmanaged scanner is a docker container that
can be run in your infrastructure. You will need to provide the service account
credentials to the container.

You may want to use the unmanaged solution when you want fine control over the scanner.
